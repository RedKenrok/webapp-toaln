# Toaln

*Toaln* is a simple language learning app which utilises the power of Large Language Models to practise.

Try the app out at [https://redkenrok.github.io/webapp-toaln/index.html](https://redkenrok.github.io/webapp-toaln/index.html).

## Running

In order to build and use the app you need to have `Node.JS` installed. You can then run `bash run_install.sh` and after that `bash run_develop.sh`. It will then tell you which port on localhost to go to in your browser to load the app.
