# Toaln

*Toaln* is a simple language learning app which utilises the power of Large Language Models to practise.

Try the app out at [https://redkenrok.github.io/webapp-toaln/index.html](https://redkenrok.github.io/webapp-toaln/index.html). In order to use it you do need to specify an API key. You can use either an Anthropic or OpenAI key.

## Running

In order to build and use the app you need to have `Node.JS` installed. You can then run `bash run_install.sh` and after that `bash run_develop.sh`. It will then tell you which port on localhost to go to in your browser to load the app.

## Translations

The Dutch and English translations are written and checked by [myself](https://github.com/redkenrok/). However the Danish and German translations are translated by computer and I do not feel confident enough in my proficiency to make verify its accuracy. If you are a native or professional speaker I would like to hear about any mistakes in the translations so it can be improved.

## Made with
